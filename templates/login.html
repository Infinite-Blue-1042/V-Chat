        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">iPhone 12</center></h2>
        <img src="iphone12final.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><b>The iPhone 12, which Apple rolled out on October 23 of 2020, is one of the best performing phones in its class. It has 5G Cellular Capabilities and since it is powered by the newest A14 Bionic Chip, it has the best chip put into a smartphone to the time of writing this blog. With a beautiful edge to edge Super Retina XDR Display ( Coming in options for 5.4 or 6.1 inches ), this makes the screen and light quality no issue. And for durability, there is a strong ceramic shield, strong aluminum frame, and a very good protection against water, with a maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes. While it has only 2 cameras on it, there are one of the best cameras in the industry. It is also compatible with wireless charging and MagSafe cases and wallets. There are 2 SIM card slots, there is the physical SIM card and eSIM. It comes in 64, 128, and 256 GB of Storage to choose from. Some other features are that there’s Face ID and that it is compatible with fast charging and charges to 50% in 30 minutes. Priced at $799 USD ( $699 for the Mini Version ), it is quite pricey, but it beats the competition in terms of the performance.</b></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">Google Pixel 4a 5G</center></h2>
        <img src="pixel4a5gfinal.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><b>Similar to the iPhone 12, the Pixel 4a 5G has 5G Cellular Capabilities ( Hence the name ), which also has a nicely sized 6.2 inch OLED Display at 1080p. It has 3 cameras on the back, and a powerful 3885 mAh battery. There are only 2 storage options to choose from, 128 GB and 256 GB. And to note, it has a headphone jack which many companies have been removing from their newest phones. It also has 2 microphones and stereo speakers for the most clear audio. The phone’s battery can also keep it going for 48 hours! This immediately knocks Google’s closest competitors, like Samsung and Apple, out of the park. With the Titan M Chip, your privacy is more secure than ever with this phone, and they guarantee a minimum of 3 years worth of OS and Security Updates, meaning that it will never run out anytime soon. Some other features worth noting is that it has an adaptive battery, meaning it learns what are your most used apps and reduces the power to ones you don’t use as often, to keep the battery running longer. It also senses that if you have been in a car accident, and immediately calls 911 for your safety at an instant. Finally, it has the dual sim card slots, with a nano Sim and an eSIM. Fairly priced at $499 compared to other smartphones.</b></p>
